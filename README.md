This repository contains the code and presentation of the group Octopus for the GirlCode Hackathon in August 2020 (details available at https://girlcodehack.devpost.com/ ). Teams were tasked with tackling any of the UN Sustainable Development Goals through a code driven product.

# Octopus 
Octopus is a web application focused on tackling UN SDGs 12 and 13 - ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns and taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impact. It provides information on what and where you can recycle in South Africa in easy to understand language. Further, the application has the capability to calculate an individual's carbon footprint and ranks users to encourage healthy competition in living more sustainably.
